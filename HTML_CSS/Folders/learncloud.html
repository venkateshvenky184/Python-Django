            <p class="blog-description">If you learn cloud computing then you can make things much easier for your projects. You do not have to rely on multiple hard drives or data storage devices for with cloud computing you can store all your important data on a remote database. To put it simply cloud computing offers the delivery of different services through the internet. These services include tools and applications such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. For a more efficient and smooth workflow, cloud computing surely seems to be taking over, and more and more people are moving to use it to the best of its services. Here’s all you need to know about it..</p>

                <strong>The Basics</strong>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The first step in this compact cloud computing course is to understand the basics. The reason why it’s called “cloud” computing is that all the information is found in a virtual or cloud space. This then can be accessed from anywhere and any device as long as one has access to the internet. This is increasingly making data sharing easier for many people. It takes away all the hard work that has to be put in to crunch and process data away from a device and carries it effortlessly to large clusters of computers, far away in cyberspace..</p>

                <strong> The Types</strong>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Any cloud computing video that you see will tell you that all clouds are different and not all type of cloud computing will be suitable for everyone. Different types serve different purposes and one ought to find the one that offers the right solution for them. To begin with, one ought to decide the type of cloud deployment on which the cloud services would be implemented, the different ways of deployment are:</p>

            <p class="blog-description">  
                <strong> Public:</strong>
                Public clouds are the ones that are owned and operated by third-party service providers and you can access their servers and storage over the internet. All you need is a web browser and an account on the service providers page. Rest everything is owned by the provider.</p>
            <br style="border-top:20px;"/>
            <p class="blog-description"><strong>Private: </strong>
                On the other hand is the private cloud wherein the resources belong to and are solely used by a business or an organization. It may even be located physically on the company’s data center. Many organizations tend to hire third-parties to manage and host their private cloud. </p>  
            <br style="border-top:20px;"/>
            <p class="blog-description"><strong>Hybrid:</strong>
                As the name suggests Hybrid cloud brings together Public and Private cloud with the help of a technology that permits data to be shared between the two. This kind of cloud allows for greater flexibility, deployment options and even optimizes your existing infrastructure.

            <strong>Cloud Services</strong>
              <br/>
              <br>
              To understand cloud computing further one ought to understand that majority of the cloud computing services come under four main categories; IaaS (Infrastructure as a service), PaaS (Platform as a service), SaaS (Serverless and Software as a service). Also known as cloud computing stack they build on top of one another. Here’s what they do:</p>
            <br style="border-top:20px;"/>
            <p class="blog-description" >IaaS: This one of the basic and cost-effective options of the cloud. You pay for it as much as you use it. With IaaS you are essentially renting an IT infrastructure such as servers and virtual machines, storage, networks, operating systems, etc. It can be used for test and development, website hosting, storage backup and more. </p>
            <br style="border-top:20px;"/>
            <p class="blog-description">PaaS: Platform as a service provide for an environment that allows one to develop, test, deliver and manage software applications. PaaS makes it much easier for developers to create web or mobile apps without having to look after the underlying infrastructure.</p>
            <br style="border-top:20px;"/>
            <p class="blog-description">Serverless: This computing is rather similar to PaaS and allows one to build app functionality without having to manage servers or infrastructure. Serverless architectures are highly scalable.</p>
            <br style="border-top:20px;"/>
            <p class="blog-description">SaaS: Software as a service allows one to deliver software applications over the internet. The providers for SaaS host and manage the software as well as the underlying infrastructure. This typically works on a subscription basis.</p>
