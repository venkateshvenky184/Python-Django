                <br/>

Apart from that, C is known to have brought to life several other languages, for they have been highly influenced by C. These include, Objective C, C# and even Java. Taking it a step further is the C++ language, which is almost the same as C but it is an object-oriented language, making it slightly better than C. Head down to Edyoda and take an application development course and learn these languages too.</p>

                <strong>Rust</strong>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Intended for low-level systems programming, Rust is much like C and C++. The different thing about Rust, though is that it adds the element of speed and security to a program. The most useful and noticeable feature of Rust is that it allows for “safe code” that prevents programs from accessing parts of data that it shouldn’t and ensures that there are no system crashes. You could learn Rust and more online web development courses only with Edyoda.</p>
